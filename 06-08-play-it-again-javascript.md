### 8: Play it again, JavaScript!

Create an application that plays that Do–Re–Mi–Fa–So–La–Ti of the Solfège.

**BONUS:**Play some chords.

Put the code into a [JSBin](http://jsbin.com) instance to hear some sounds directly in your browser.

HINT: I'm just gonna leave [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) here.

### Strategy
assign each solfege syllable to a sound node (OscillatorNode or  PeriodicWave)
fa = activate some node

if input == 'fa' play sound in node faNode
